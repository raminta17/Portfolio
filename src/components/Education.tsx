                        Throughout the course, I've successfully developed numerous individual front-end and full-stack
                        applications from inception to completion using Javascript, React, Typescript and Node.js. One
                        highlight of my journey was being as part of a small, high-achieving group to
                        collaborate on creating an admin page for our lecturer's upcoming project, scheduled for release
                        early next year. This experience not only honed my teamwork and problem-solving skills but also
                        allowed me to contribute to a real-world project with tangible impact.
